# Tic-Tac-Toe
Python Tic-Tac-Toe - This Python program allows two players to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' in empty spaces. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Features:
* Simple command-line interface.
* Tracks player turns and validates moves.
* Displays the board after each move.
* Detects a win or a draw and ends the game accordingly. 


How to Play:
* Players take turns entering the row and column numbers (1, 2) to place their mark.
* The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.
